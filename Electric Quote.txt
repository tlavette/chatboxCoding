Electric Quote

Calculate the total dollar amount for materials with user input. 1 Receptical = $1.50, 1 = Switch $1.00, 1 = GFI $23, 15 ft TwelveTwo Wire = $30, 100 ft NumberEight Wire = $140.  "Your total estimate for materials is:  "




### Plan

1. Define a function `calculate_materials_cost` that takes the quantities of receptacles, switches, GFIs, TwelveTwo wire (in feet), and NumberEight wire (in feet) as parameters.
2. Define the cost for each item.
3. Calculate the total cost for each type of material.
4. Sum the total costs to get the overall total.
5. Return the total cost.
6. Create a main function to get user input for the quantities of each material.
7. Call the `calculate_materials_cost` function with the user inputs.
8. Print the result.

### Code

```python
def calculate_materials_cost(receptacles, switches, gfis, twelve_two_wire_ft, number_eight_wire_ft):
    # Define costs
    cost_receptacle = 1.50
    cost_switch = 1.00
    cost_gfi = 23.00
    cost_twelve_two_wire_per_15ft = 30.00
    cost_number_eight_wire_per_100ft = 140.00
    
    # Calculate total costs
    total_receptacles = receptacles * cost_receptacle
    total_switches = switches * cost_switch
    total_gfis = gfis * cost_gfi
    total_twelve_two_wire = (twelve_two_wire_ft / 15) * cost_twelve_two_wire_per_15ft
    total_number_eight_wire = (number_eight_wire_ft / 100) * cost_number_eight_wire_per_100ft
    
    # Sum total costs
    total_cost = total_receptacles + total_switches + total_gfis + total_twelve_two_wire + total_number_eight_wire
    return total_cost

    # Calculate the total cost
    total_cost = calculate_materials_cost(receptacles, switches, gfis, twelve_two_wire_ft, number_eight_wire_ft)
    
    # Print the result
